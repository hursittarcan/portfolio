Iâ€™ve always been someone who has both a creative and a logical side. When I discovered web and software development in college, I realized that it would be the perfect fit for me. I could use my creative side to design, and my logical side to code.\n\n As an extra, I love working with languages. I'm certified in six different languages, I work on different open-source translation projects and I'm Translation Lead for Ethereum.org.",
